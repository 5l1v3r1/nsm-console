DONE - From Scholar: IP->ASN mapping, a module (ip2asn)
DONE - From Scholar: IP->ASN mapping, a command (ip2asn)
DONE - Upgrade revision of pcapparser library (support flags)
DONE - 'print' command should print TCP flags using newer revision of pcapparser library
SEMI-DONE - From Scholar: Some way to extract a list of IPs from a pcap (iplist)
DONE - Change "run" so you can use "run aimsnarf" to run the aimsnarf module without toggling, etc
DONE - Path error for modules when relative path is used, the full path to a file is now used (Grzegorz)
DONE - add 'iplist' command to get a list of IP addresses, sorted by numbers
DONE - Add yahsnarf module (extract yahoo IM conversations)
DONE - Need pipes into commands and files, this includes but is not limited to: > < >> | (All except for < are done)
DONE - Pipe redirection requires an extra enter to get a prompt, figure out why and fix it.
DONE - Tempfile problems with gzip'd pcap files, use a regular file instead
DONE - Add encoding method of just "hex" instead of hex_LSB and hex_MSB

Version 0.6
DONE - rot13 encode/decode
DONE - Fix error with an alias handling arguments
DONE - Add 'dump' command, similar to print, dump binary payload of packet(s) to a file
DONE - Warning when file doesn't exist
DONE - Harimau attempts to use wget if it can, since it's about 10 times faster than Net::HTTP
DONE - Argus rdns lookups were killing the speed. Added '-n' so it doesn't do that by default
DONE - checkip tried to use wget if it's installed, should be much much faster
DONE - tcptrace doesn't do rdns lookups because it was dying, -n is the default now
DONE - fixed a typo in urlescape (en|de)coding, thanks John!
DONE - Add clamscan module
DONE - Use rawpacket's tcpxtract.conf instead of the regular one. (extract many many more types)
DONE - Add foremost module
DONE - let the clamscan module select which extraction dir it wants to look in (foremost? tcpxtract?)
DONE - Need to add "color on", instead of just off and toggle
DONE - Auto gunzip pcap files on the fly (only for .gz extensions) (doesn't work for directories)
DONE - Clean up the autogunzipping
DONE - Create the temp file in the NSM-Console directory, file is cleaned up on exit
DONE - Directories support gzip'd files for modules, print and dump
DONE (N/A)- dump doesn't like temp files, fix this -- doesn't matter any more, since gunzip the file once by default
DONE - gunzip once, not every time, silly me.
DONE - Separate the bro alarms and extracting the bro contents
DONE - Update Snort rules (community and emerging)
DONE - add "-f" tag to dump command to allow for full dumping of selected packets
DONE - Add the trace-summary module (http://www.icir.org/robin/trace-summary/)
