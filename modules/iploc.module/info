The iploc module will read the pcap file and query the hostip.info database for
the locations of inbound and outbound traffic, it will then dump the results
into a comma-separated file to be read by a different program. The format is as
follows:

<ip address>,<country>,<city and state>,<latitude>,<longitude>,<packet count>
